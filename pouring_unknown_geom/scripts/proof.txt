what are legendre
how does it relate to volume

theorem: 
If two containers sit on the same legendre vector iff their geometry functions are scalar multiples

prove sufficiency and neccessity: sufficient that Vi = kVj  then ri = k rj neccessity, if 

A: containrs are scaled  B: containers sit on same vector  
if A then B 
if B then A

proving suff and necc then iff A then B
